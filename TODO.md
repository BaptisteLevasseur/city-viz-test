# TODO list

* Back that gets as input a longitude and latitude
* Back that gets data from the geo api
* Front that displays a map
* Front that gets the back-end data with default inputs and then displays it
* Possibility to change the inputs on the front

* Add an history of the previous geometries (store the previous ones in DynamoDB maybe)
* Create the possibility to add several locations, store it and make a geometry figure
  based on it
* Create the possibility to choose an already created geometry map

# Ideas

* Given a longitude/latitude, sends back the region in France corresponding
* Given a longitude/latitude, sends the closest city and the area of the city
* Drawing mode : post longitude/latitude or name of a city, store it in a DynamoDB database and display a polygon with the different cities stored
